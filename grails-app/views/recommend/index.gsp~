			<h1>Your Cost Center Recommendations</h1>
			<p>Some useful tips and information on improving your cost center's efficiency</p>

			<div>
			<ol>
			<li>Measure your server room’s energy consumption - what you’re doing with our app!
Always have a baseline measurement of your energy consumption, this allows for cost-effectiveness evaluation of energy efficiency improvements, while also having a reference for the problem or wasteful server energy use.</li>
			<li>Switch off unused servers - Both large and small server rooms house servers which do absolutely nothing, due to the application which they were intended for being decommissioned, but the servers being left on and running. Be vigilant that no servers fall through the cracks of the asset management process.</li>
			<li>Set servers to go into low power mode when inactive - Analyse server usage to identify times when they are idle for prolonged periods and thus able to go into low power mode. When the CPU is operating at low utilization, the power-management feature minimizes wasted energy by dynamically ratcheting down processor power states (lower voltage and frequency) when peak performance isn't required. Adaptive power management reduces power consumption without compromising processing capability. This low power mode uses just a fraction of the power, while still being fully ready to respond to requests when they occur.</li>
			<li>Optimise resources using virtualisation and consolidation - Use apps similar to this one over time to identify servers which can be consolidated into running together, either on a physical machine, or on a virtualised server which runs applications on several virtual machines housed on one machine, or moved from one physical server to another depending on load conditions. Virtualisation can allow consolidation rates of up to 15:1, and while virtualised host servers are more powerful and thus use more energy, the cost savings related to cooling and housing cannot be ignored.</li>
			<li>Examine power back up requirements - Redundant equipment in the power delivery chain increases capital cost and consumes additional energy, as power conversions create heat which must then be removed. Not all IT equipment needs backup power; for example, some applications can simply be restarted without significant adverse effects when an electrical power disruption occurs.  Some applications failover to other IT equipment, so dual individual power supplies are not required.  As these examples show, utility customers should analyze these systems to determine whether or not power conditioning or backup is needed; this helps to avoid costly redundant equipment that consumes additional energy.</li>
			<li>Use IT equipment with high-efficiency power supplies - After the CPU, the second biggest culprit in power consumption is the power supply unit (PSU), which converts incoming alternating current (AC) power to direct current (DC) and requires about 25 percent of the server's power budget for that task. The typical PSU operates at around 80-percent efficiency — often as low as 60 or 70 percent. PSUs have been developed which operate at up to 90-percent efficiency, and while the initial cost of such an efficient power supply unit is higher, but the energy savings quickly repay it. A data center with 1,000 servers could save €100,000 on its annual energy bill by making this change.</li>
			<li>Use high-efficiency UPSs.
Most IT equipment isn't directly powered from the facility power source. Power typically passes through an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for power assurance and power distribution units (PDUs) that distribute the power at the required voltage throughout racks and enclosures.
Even small increases in UPS efficiency can quickly translate into thousands of euro, while high UPS efficiency extends battery runtime and produces cooler operating conditions within the UPS. Lower temperatures extend the life of components and increase overall reliability and performance.</li>
		<li>Airflow management - Airflow management is conceptually simple and surprisingly easy to implement. Your challenge: ensuring that the cool air from your cooling equipment gets to the front of your IT gear, without getting mixed up with the hot air coming from the back, or short-circuiting back to the cooling unit. In an ideal world the cold supply air would be directly ducted to your IT equipment, and the hot return air would be ducted directly back to the intake of the cooling unit(s). In practice, you only need to do one or the other, and there are interim improvements you can make that take far less effort. Sketching out and reviewing where air is coming from and going to and clearing up the path is simple, and it may eliminate overheating issues altogether.</li>
		<li>Move some applications to the cloud - Outsourcing some of your IT needs to the cloud doesn’t just move the energy problem elsewhere, due to cost efficiencies from economies of scale cloud computing is generally greener than in-house computing, with a recent Microsoft-Accenture study estimating that using cloud computing can reduce the carbon footprint of applications by up to 30%.</li>
		<li>Consider facilities and hardware efficiency
While smart server use offers the largest energy saving gains, it’s important not to overlook efficiencies which could be harnessed through correct facilities configuration. Studies show that most server rooms are overcooled, which wastes energy. Furthermore, in recent years huge strides have been taken in the energy efficiency of server hardware, thus large energy savings can be made by purchasing the most energy efficient servers in their class.</li>
